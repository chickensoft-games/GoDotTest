Thank you for taking the time to read this contributing guide and for showing interest in helping this project!

Please read our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct). We do our best to treat others fairly and foster a welcoming environment.

## Project Setup

This is a C# nuget package, for use with the .NET SDK 6 or 7. As such, the `dotnet` tool will allow you to restore packages and build projects.

The `Chickensoft.GoDotTest.Tests` project must be built with the Godot editor at least once before `dotnet build` will succeed. Godot has to generate the .NET bindings for the project, since tests run in an actual game environment.

## Coding Guidelines

Your IDE should automatically adhere to the style guidelines in the provided `.editorconfig` file. Please try to keep lines under 80 characters long whenever possible.

We try to write tests for our projects to ensure a certain level of quality. We are willing to give you support and guidance if you need help!

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].

> We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
